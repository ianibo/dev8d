This is the readme for LazyLecturer

Structure
---------

/cook
	The django app for processing bookmarklet requests and auto tagging them in delicious
	Dependencies - needs pydelicious 0.5.2rc2 from http://code.google.com/p/pydelicious/ readme has install instructions.

/bookmarklet
	The bookmarklet code


Installation
------------

To build / Install the web service you will need to check out the build tree from github. Use the following command

git clone git@github.com:ianibo/dev8d.git 

This will check the project and it's components out 

*Important*
You will need to eddit ~/LazyLecturer/cook/select.py and change the delicious credentials. Be careful not to check in username/password to GitHub or the world will see your password

You will need to install the Google AppEngine SDK to deploy the app.

In order to run the web service on your local server 

cd $GoogleAppEngineHome
./dev_appserver.py /path/to/checked.out/app

for me this works as

ibbo@plank:~/dev8d/LazyLecturer$ cd /opt/google_appengine/
ibbo@plank:/opt/google_appengine$ ./dev_appserver.py /home/ibbo/dev8d/LazyLecturer/cook


To hard deploy to google app engine use

./appcfg.py  update /home/ibbo/dev8d/LazyLecturer/cook

(Need user perms to deploy, mail ianibbo@googlemail.com with details of your google app engine username so I can add you to the list of people able to deploy.

Usage
-----

http://lazylecturer.appspot.com/

The web service should talk to 

http://lazylecturer.appspot.com/ 
or http://localhost:8080

and the path to select a resource and add it to delicious is

/select/?resource_url=http://ianibbo.blogspot.com&resource_text=fred

where resource_url is the URL of the target (Pref URL encoded ;))
and resource_text is the optional comment text

After this call, the resource will be available in delicious, or an error will occour.
